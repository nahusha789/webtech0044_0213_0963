Final Stretch of Run,"Dear Students,

Many of you are such committed, sincere and hardworking students that I am fortunate to have in HP course so much so that I can not stop telling my colleagues in university and even in IISc, about how proud I feel of you.

We are in the final stretch of run whereby I am planning the final evaluation of a project with a weightage of 25 marks in a week or so and the exact schedule will be intimated. For  this you need at the least ACM journal format detailed report for which template is already shared as well as final ppt and demo (preferably video)

I encourage you to additionally consider contributing an A3 or bigger size poster conveying your project and contribution graphically to any layman.

Many of you have already started reviewing courses, I will be soon scheduling some review sessions as well and it is important to you to do given reading and important programming exercises record your doubt formally in the excel sheet shared in a lesson wise fashion.

I wish you all good luck, health and a great career!",0

Age detection with OpenCV and Deep Learning,"Hi,

In today’s brand-new tutorial, you will learn how to perform automatic age detection/prediction using OpenCV, Deep Learning, and Python:
Image
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to automatically predict age in static image files and real-time video streams, with reasonably high accuracy.

Click here to see the full tutorial, including source code and pre-trained age detector model.

Adrian Rosebrock
Chief PyImageSearcher

P.S. In the blog post, I show you how to use a pre-trained age detector — if you instead want to learn how to train the age detector from scratch, I would recommend you check out my book, Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python.

Inside the book you’ll find:
Super-practical walkthroughs that present solutions to actual real-world image classification (ResNet, VGG, etc.), object detection (Faster R-CNN, SSDs, RetinaNet, etc.), and segmentation (Mask R-CNN) problems
Hands-on tutorials (with lots of code) that show you not only the algorithms behind deep learning for computer vision but their implementations as well
A no-nonsense teaching style that is guaranteed to help you master deep learning for image understanding and visual recognition
If you’re interested in learning more about the book, I’d be happy to send you a PDF containing the Table of Contents and a few sample chapters:

Click here to grab the PDF of sample chapters and Table of Contents.

After clicking the above link, you’ll receive a separate email with the PDF in a few short moments.
